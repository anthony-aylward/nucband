# nucband
Utility functions for calculating nucleosome banding scores from ATAC-seq data.

Adapted from [Andrew Hill's R script](https://github.com/shendurelab/mouse-atac/blob/master/banding_scores/calculate_nucleosome_banding_scores.R), which contains methodology for [Cusanovich et al.'s publication].

See [this doc](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/eeid/2010/Ecology/Spectral.pdf) for an introduction to spectral analysis.
